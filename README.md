# Zion: The Generative Storefront
### Next.js Global Hackathon Project

Welcome, Hackathon Jury! ðŸ‘‹

The era of vibe shopping is upon us! Get ready to explore ZION, our vision for the future of e-commerce, built with Next.js, Medusa, Vercel AI SDK, Upstash, OpenAI and Supabase.

Built by Victor Gerbrands ([@VariableVic](https://github.com/variablevic)) and Miljan Janjetovic ([@miljan19](https://github.com/miljan19)).

**Visit the ~[Live Demo](#)~**! In the demo, Zion is selling vintage furniture, but it could be connected to any Medusa store.

## What's Under the Hood?

Zion isn't just another online store. It's an intelligent experience. Instead of browsing standard product overviews, you create your own by talking to the assistant. This creates a truly personalized journey for every shopper.

We're leveraging powerful technologies:

- **Next.js App Router:** Delivering a blazing-fast, server-rendered frontend.
- **Medusa:** Providing a robust, composable commerce engine.
- **Vercel AI SDK:** For seamless AI chat and generative UI features.
- **OpenAI:** Powering the intelligent assistant capabilities.
- **Upstash:** Vector for fast product search and Redis for application and canvas state.
- **Supabase:** Used for storage.

## What can Zion do?

Zion acts as a personal AI shopping assistant, capable of:

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggesting products tailored to your vibe and preferences.
- **Immersive Storytelling:** Weaving engaging narratives around products to bring them to life.
- **Dynamic UI Generation:** Adapting the interface based on the conversation for a seamless flow.
- **Access Cart and Checkout:** Guiding you through the entire purchase process via chat.

## Why is this Exciting?

- **Innovation:** We're pushing the boundaries of what an ecommerce platform can be.
- **Personalization:** AI allows for unprecedented levels of personalized shopping experiences.
- **Hackathon Spirit:** Developed with passion, rapid prototyping, and a drive to innovate!

Zion showcases how AI can transform online retail, making it more dynamic, engaging, and personalized. We're excited to share our progress!
